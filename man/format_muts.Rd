\title{This function filters hypermutated samples and returns the formatted mutations with the appropriate trinucleotide context}
\usage{
format_muts(mutations, filter_hyper_MB = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutations}{A data frame with the following columns: chr, pos1, pos2, ref, alt, patient
\describe{
    \item{chr}{autosomal chromosomes as chr1 to chr22 and sex chromosomes as chrX and chrY}
    \item{pos1}{the start position of the mutation in base 1 coordinates}
    \item{pos2}{the end position of the mutation in base 1 coordinates}
    \item{ref}{the reference allele as a string containing the bases A, T, C or G}
    \item{alt}{the alternate allele as a string containing the bases A, T, C or G}
    \item{patient}{the patient identifier as a string}
}}

\item{filter_hyper_MB}{The number of mutations per megabase for which a sample is considered hypermutated.
Hypermutated samples will be removed in further analyses.}
}
\value{
a data frame called mutations which has been formatted with an extra column for trinucleotide context
}
